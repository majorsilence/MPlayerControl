    <summary>A mplayer and mencoder c# wrapper library.  This package includes the winform control.</summary>
    <description>MPlayerControl is a library written in C# and usable from an .NET language (C#, IronPython, VB.NET, IronRuby, etc..) and example program for accessing mplayer and mencoder. With it you can watch video,  listen to audio, or convert videos. You can also do anything that is possible with mencoder.

This is a .NET 4.5 wrapper library for MPlayer.  It has been tested on Windows XP/7/8 and Ubuntu Linux 10.10/11.04/12.04/13.04/14.04 and OpenSuse Linux 10.3.  It should also work on OS X although it has not been tested.
