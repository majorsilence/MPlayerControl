This is a .NET 4.5 wrapper library for MPlayer.  It has been tested on Windows XP/7/8 and Ubuntu Linux 10.10/11.04/12.04/13.04/14.04/16.04 and OpenSuse Linux 10.3.  It should also work on OS X although it has not been tested.  Written in C#.

LibMPlayerCommon requires "mplayer.exe" to exist in the same directory as the dll or the path must be specified.  On linux mplayer may be in the path and work without specifying a path or having mplayer in the same directory.  Download mplayer for windows from http://oss.netfarm.it/mplayer-win32.php. It may require some tweaks to getting working on some systems.

It can play both audio and video files. It includes a sample user interface.

It currently supports play, pause, stop. seek and some other basic functionality. I only add new features as I require them or people send in patches.

See examples on the wiki pages https://github.com/majorsilence/MPlayerControl/wiki.
